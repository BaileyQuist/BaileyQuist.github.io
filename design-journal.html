        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies you’d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>Response: I hope to learn useful code in a way that helps me commit it to memory. I'd like to be able to use it to personalize my design website in a way that is more reflective of my work as an artist and designer. </p>
        <p>I'd be really interested to learn about adding basic animation to a website, like ones that are activated by scroll or touch.</p>
        <p>I don't spend much time looking at many websites, so I can't say there are any I've seen that are particularly exciting to me. However, I hope that changes by the end of the term.</p>

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?</p>
        <p>Response: For project 1 I'm doing a website on hidden role tabletop games. I want to show 4 of the most popular games: Werewolf, Spyfall, BANG! and Secret Hitler. I want to give each page its own layout with headers that thematically fit the game, but have some illustrative elements that are consistent. I want my typography to be easy to read and use color to emphasize the mystery and fun of the games.</p>

        <h2>Week Six</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What did you choose the business/cause that you chose? Why do you think your redesign will be better? What area/content will you focus on in your redesign? Look at two other similar websites. What stands out about those sites? what bothers you abut them? How will you improve things in your own design.</p>
        <p>Response: I chose my favorite comic book store, Cosmic Monkey. I think my redesign will be better because their current website is a bit crowded and the layout isn't engaging. I'm going to focus on layout and organization. For similar websites, I took a look at Excalibur Comics and Books With Pictures. Excalibur's website is great. It has minimal content and is easy to look at. However, everything lives on one main page. Books With Pictures is also minimal, but not in a fun way. There's no engaging design to it and everything is uneven. To make mine better, I'll make the main page easier to scroll through and cut down on the amount of subpages.</p>
